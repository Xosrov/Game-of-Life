# Game-of-Life
A simple console version of the well known cellular automaton, Game Of Life.
One of my first C++ projects, where I've tried to use most of what i've learned. Written on linux, not sure if it works on other OS's(although I'm sure some minimal changes would make it compatible).

Just compile and execute the .cpp files, all basic info provided after executing the code, and additional info found in comments.
